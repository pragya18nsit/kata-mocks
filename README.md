## Problem

Character Copy Kata
The character copier is a simple class that reads characters from a source and copies them to a destination 
one character at a time.
When the method Copy is called on the copier then it should read characters from the source and copy them to the
destination until the source returns a newline (\n).
The exercise is to implement the character copier using test doubles for the source and the destination -
try using spies (manually written mocks) and mocks written with a mocking framework.
Start from these definitions:

## Implementation

public class Copier
{
public Copier(â€¦) {}
public void Copy() {}
}

public interface ISource
{
char GetChar();
}

public interface IDestination
{
void SetChar(char character);
}
